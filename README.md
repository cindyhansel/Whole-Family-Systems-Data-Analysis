# Whole-Family-Systems-Data-Analysis
Qualitative data analysis based on in-person interviews of individuals.

Analysis was completed in June, 2020.

### The Partners

Intercultural Mutual Assistance Association, IMAA, is a 501(c)(3) non profit founded in 1984 by Mr. Robert “Bob” Jones III (1942-2011). 

Refugees and immigrants arrive in Rochester from many different countries around the world including Somalia, Syria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Burma, Bhutan, and Iraq. They have demonstrated strength, perseverance, resourcefulness, and courage in the face of remarkable hardships and challenges.

IMAA has served hundreds of newcomers every year by helping to create stability, self-sufficiency, independence, and to build community. As a result, many have attained these goals and have become engaged, established, and contributing members of the community.

Whole Family Systems, WFS, is a program within IMAA which focuses on addressing the challenges of refugee and immigrant families in early child development. The program is a family-driven model that identifies current issues, with inclusive and equitable family-driven solutions to inform shifts in programs, policy, and practice at the state level.

Cradle 2 Career, C2C, is a community-wide initiative that works to improve educational outcomes for every child in Rochester by transforming the way partners work together. 

C2C builds relationships across multiple sectors – nonprofit, business, government, and philanthropy – to determine successful strategies, break down barriers, and create new possibilities to support youth and families furthest from opportunity.

Cradle 2 Career uses data-driven methodology to evaluate and accomplish goals set by their partners.

### Description of Project

Narrative data came from interviews of 80+ individuals of families of immigrants and refugees in Rochester, MN, who had children ages 5 and under. The intention of the analysis was to
provide a report for program and support planning for newcomers in the area.

The team’s approach relied on existing relationships and outreach worker experience and use loosely-structured interviews to promote authentic conversations. Interviewers went through training to ensure they were prepared. Interviewees received a check in appreciation for their participation and to cover their costs associated with the interview process.

Interview topics included technology, transportation, language, jobs, food, and friends and family support circles to understand successes and barriers that existed in early childhood education.

### The Analysis

Analysis was completed and reported by the data team from Cradle 2 Career which consisted of Kelsey Zubke, Data and Research Manager, and Cindy Hansel, Data Analyst. Evaluators from United Way of Olmsted County participated in regular discussions about the analysis. 

Open-ended responses were themed and coded, then all responses were quantified by the following disaggregations:

* Children in early education (or not)
* Time spent in the US
* Language spoken at home
* Gender
* Education level of the parent

Qualitative analysis methodology, data cleaning, theming, Excel pivot tables, data ethics, inter-cultural collaboration, and report design were key skills for the success of this project. Strong working relationships between analysists, interviewers, interpreters, and cultural experts were essential in understanding how to theme and categorize this qualitative data.
